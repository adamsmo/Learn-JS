**This is npm based project based on React 15**

There is main page index.html that loads main component `Main.js` 
There are several configuration for deploying this application to: `dev` `dist` `test`

there is folder `src/stores` wich looks like it should be named differently because this app shoud be about cooking recipies (?)

styles are in `src/styles` and looks like they are using plain css, maybe it should be changed to less?
